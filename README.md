# BalanceBoost
Balance Bost is a user-friendly expense tracking tool that allows you to effortlessly 
track your spending by uploading your bank statements as .csv files. With the option 
to customize categories, you can easily view a breakdown of your expenses. Currently, 
the webapp supports statements from popular banks such as Ally Bank, Bank of America, 
Discover, Chase, and Wells Fargo. The tool was developed using Python/Flask for the 
back-end and HTML, JavaScript, and CSS for the front-end. While the core functionality 
is complete, future plans include adding features to view your expense breakdown by 
month and the option to filter your transaction, making it even easier to manage your 
finances.

To get started with the website, simply create an account, then head to the upload 
page to upload your transactions. Once your file is uploaded, you'll be redirected 
to the summary page, where you can add or delete categories as needed. From there, 
you can navigate to the transaction page, where you can assign categories to your 
transactions. Note that many bank statements already have categories when uploaded, 
which you can either keep or change to better suit your needs. If you encounter any 
issues with your transaction page, you can delete your transactions. Currently, there 
is only an option to delete all categories, but additional features may be added 
in the future.
